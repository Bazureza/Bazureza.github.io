## About Me
Hello, my name is Bayu Reza Gunawan and I am a 2D programmer. I am currently studying at Brawijaya university and I take Major of Informatics Engineering.

My main interests are gameplay, AI, and UI. I love creating the feel of a game, such as making a jump feel nice or tweaking movement speeds. I like collaborating with designers to create cool, weird or unique mechanics also create beautiful and cool UI.
Game Jams are one of my favourite things to do, but I also regularly have hobby projects to work on in my spare time.

## Adventure of time about my self 

### Jamber (Jam Bersama)
Jamber, it was my first jam. at that time I don't know about jam or game development all I know it was an event about making games.  Personally, I love playing a game and because of that,  I am interested to move from player to creator.  It was my friend who asks me to join. All I know back then just try and learn all about game programming. Yeah, that was a great moment, because from that start, now I become more passionate to create games.

### Global Game Jam 2019
"What home means to you", that was the main theme of global game jam 2019. it was my first time to work as a team and as the main programmer. My team creates a battle brawl platformer game with a shooting mechanic. It was a great idea that my designer give it to us but in 3 days we only make the main mechanic. surely it was hard but it is so fun.
