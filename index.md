## About Me
Hello, my name is Bayu Reza Gunawan and I am a 2D programmer. I am currently studying at Brawijaya university and I take Major of Informatics Engineering.

My main interests are gameplay and AI. I love creating the feel of a game, such as making a jump feel nice or tweaking movement speeds. I like collaborating with designers to create cool, weird or unique mechanics.

Game Jams are one of my favourite things to do, but I also regularly have hobby projects to work on in my spare time.
